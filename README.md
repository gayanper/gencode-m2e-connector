# GenCode-M2E-Connector
M2E connector that can be configured to connect generated source directories which result of maven plug-in which doesn't have m2e connectors. 

By default this connector is mapped with maven `maven-resources-plugin:resources`plug-in. So if you have any maven plug-in which doesn't have a m2e connector, you will need to run the maven build once and then update the maven project configuration in eclipse IDE which will connect the generated source directories.
